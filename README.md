#### **Project Title: Physician Notetaker - Medical Transcription and NLP Pipeline**

---

#### **Project Overview**
This project aims to build an **AI system for medical transcription**, **NLP-based summarization**, and **sentiment analysis** based on physician-patient conversations. The system extracts key medical details (e.g., symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis), analyzes patient sentiment and intent, and generates structured medical reports (e.g., SOAP notes).

---

#### **Key Features**
1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - Extracts **Symptoms**, **Diagnosis**, **Treatment**, and **Prognosis** from patient-physician conversations.
   - Uses a fine-tuned **BioBERT model** for medical entity recognition.

2. **Text Summarization**:
   - Summarizes the conversation into a concise medical report using **BART** or **T5**.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Classifies patient sentiment as **Anxious**, **Neutral**, or **Reassured** using **DistilBERT**.

4. **Intent Detection**:
   - Identifies patient intent (e.g., "Seeking reassurance," "Reporting symptoms," "Expressing concern") using **Zero-Shot Classification**.

5. **SOAP Note Generation**:
   - Converts the conversation into a structured **SOAP note** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).

### **1. How would you handle ambiguous or missing medical data in the transcript?**

#### **Answer:**
To handle ambiguous or missing medical data, the project uses a combination of **rule-based fallback mechanisms** and **context-aware models**. For example:
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: If a symptom or diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the conversation, the system uses predefined rules to infer likely entities based on context. For instance, if the patient mentions "pain in the neck and back," the system can infer "whiplash injury" as a likely diagnosis.
- **Context-Aware Models**: The fine-tuned **BioBERT model** is used to infer missing information by analyzing the context of the conversation. For example, if the patient mentions "I’ve been taking painkillers," the system can infer that the treatment includes "painkillers."

#### **Effectiveness**:
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: Ensures that the system can still generate meaningful outputs even when data is incomplete.
- **Context-Aware Models**: Improves the accuracy of entity extraction by leveraging the context of the conversation.
