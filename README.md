### **Physician Notetaker - Medical Transcription and NLP Pipeline**

---

## **Project Overview**
This project is designed to build an **AI-powered medical transcription system** that extracts key medical details from physician-patient conversations, analyzes patient sentiment and intent, and generates structured medical reports (e.g., SOAP notes). The system leverages **state-of-the-art NLP models** to automate clinical documentation, reduce manual effort, and improve healthcare efficiency.

## **Key Features**
1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - Extracts **Symptoms**, **Diagnosis**, **Treatment**, and **Prognosis** from conversations.
   - Uses a **fine-tuned BioBERT model** for accurate medical entity recognition.

2. **Text Summarization**:
   - Summarizes conversations into concise medical reports using **BART**.
   - Ensures readability and clinical relevance.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Classifies patient sentiment as **Anxious**, **Neutral**, or **Reassured** using **DistilBERT**.
   - Helps physicians understand patient concerns and emotional state.

4. **Intent Detection**:
   - Identifies patient intent (e.g., "Seeking reassurance," "Reporting symptoms") using **Zero-Shot Classification**.
   - Provides actionable insights for better patient care.

5. **SOAP Note Generation**:
   - Converts conversations into structured **SOAP notes** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).
   - Ensures compliance with clinical documentation standards.

   - Detect patient intent using zero-shot classification.

4. **SOAP Note Generation**:
   - Generate structured SOAP notes from the conversation.
   - Use rule-based techniques to ensure consistency.

5. **CLI Interface**:
   - Provide a command-line interface for users to input transcripts and view results.
